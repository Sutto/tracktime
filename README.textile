h1. TrackTime

TrackTime, aka @trt@, is a micro-time tracking application
written in ruby. It has zero fluff, 1 dependency and is decidedly
minimalistic. Hell, it could probably be rewriting as a rake
task just as easily.



Usage:

Clone and instal thor.

@trt@ or @trt status@ for the current project status, add @-a@ for
status across all projects.

@trt in@ to clock in.

@trt out@ to clock out.

Entries are stores in @~/trt.yml@
